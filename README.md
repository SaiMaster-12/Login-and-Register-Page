# Login-and-Register-Page

It is a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript setup for a signin-signup page with a responsive design. The HTML file (index.html) contains forms for both signing in and signing up, styled using CSS (style.css). The JavaScript file (script.js) adds functionality to switch between signin and signup forms and also prevents the default form submission behavior, redirecting to "home.html" upon login button click.

To run the code:

Ensure you have the three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) saved in the same directory.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
You should see the signin-signup page with options to sign in or sign up.
Clicking on the "Sign up" button switches to the sign-up form, and clicking on the "Sign in" button switches back to the sign-in form.
The login button triggers a redirect to "home.html" when clicked, simulating a successful login action.
